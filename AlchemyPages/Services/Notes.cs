    // Used only for notes:

    //To do: 
    // - add a log to the player knowledge page so that we can see changes made
    // - added logic to pull link players name / id with ingredient name / id and qualites, this doesn't work yet, so we need to update it.
    // - add ability to edit the quality number to the admin/playerknowledge page
    // - add player page that shows them what does what.

    // - assure the await method is use with the above^
    // - Remove ingredient encounter model and table.
    // - introduce functionality to delete player, that enables us to delete all associated entries, so for example remove entries with that player name from the playerknowledge table.


    // - logic is not updating on "create ingredient page" - debug this. - <CHECK THIS>
    // - update the html form to form-select from for-control for type / elements / qualities 1,2 & 3

    // - look at creating user / admin sort of interface -
    // - add logic for delete process in both the ingredients section and the player sections.
